Ec2 for solutions architect:
============================
- EC2 instances are billed by the second, t2.micro is free tier
- On Linux/Mac we use SSH, on windows we use putty
- SSH is on port 22, lock down the security group to your IP
- Timeout issues => Security groups issues
- Permission issues on the SSH key => run "chmod 0400"
- Security Groups can reference other security groups instead of IP ranges(very popular exam question)
- know the difference between Private, Public and Elastic IP
- You can customize an EC2 instance at boot time using EC2 User Data
- Know the 4 EC2 launch modes:

	- Reserved
	- Spot Instances
	- Dedicated Hosts
- Know the basic instacne types: R,C,M,I,G,T2/T3
- You can create AMIs to pre-install software on your EC2 => faster boot
- AMI can be copied across regions and accounts
- Images can be copied across regions and accounts
- EC2 instances can be started in placement groups:
